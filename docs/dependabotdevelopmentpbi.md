Here’s a detailed and professionally formatted DevOps PBI description for updating the Dependabot configuration in the `azurelustre-csi-driver` GitHub project:

---

# **Title**
Update Dependabot Configuration to Target `development` Branch in `azurelustre-csi-driver`

---

# **Objective**
Ensure that Dependabot monitors the `development` branch for dependency updates and creates pull requests (PRs) directly against it, aligning with the project's branching strategy and CI/CD workflow.

---

# **Background**
Currently, the `azurelustre-csi-driver` repository is configured with Dependabot to monitor the default branch (`main`) for outdated dependencies. However, the active development work and integration testing occur on the `development` branch. This misalignment causes extra effort in identifying and resolving dependency issues during the development cycle and may lead to merge conflicts or overlooked updates, as any pull requests created by dependabot target the wrong branch.

To streamline the development process and improve early detection of dependency vulnerabilities, the Dependabot configuration must be updated to target the `development` branch.

---

# **Scope**
This PBI covers the following tasks:

- Create a `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration file. See [https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference).
- Modify the configuration to set the `development` branch as the target for all package ecosystems.
- Validate the updated configuration in a test PR or fork if necessary.
- Monitor the first few PRs generated by Dependabot to ensure correct behavior.

---

# **Steps**

1. **Create Configuration File**
   - Create a `.github/dependabot.yml` file in the repository.

2. **Add Necessary Config With Target Branch**
   - Add expected values for monitoring golang dependencies, with `target-branch` under `updates`:
     ```yaml
     updates:
       - package-ecosystem: "gomod"
         directory: "/"
         schedule:
           interval: "daily"
         target-branch: "development"
     ```
   - We may also consider adding a stanza for `github-actions` or any other useful configuration. 

3. **Monitor Behavior**
   - After merging, observe Dependabot’s activity to confirm it creates PRs against the `development` branch.

4. **Optionally Configure Main Branch To Not Accept PRs**
   - We may want to have the `main` branch locked down by default, and require a manual change when we are ready to merge completed releases in. 

---

# **Testing**

- Validate that Dependabot opens PRs targeting `development` instead of `main`.
- Confirm that PRs pass CI checks and integrate cleanly with the `development` branch.
- Optionally, test in a forked repo or sandbox environment before applying to production.

---

# **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] `.github/dependabot.yml` is created with `target-branch: development` for all relevant ecosystems.
- [ ] Dependabot successfully opens PRs against the `development` branch.
- [ ] PRs pass CI/CD checks and do not introduce merge conflicts.
- [ ] Documentation (if any) referencing Dependabot behavior is updated accordingly.

---

# **Timeline**

| Task | Estimated Duration |
|------|--------------------|
| Review current config | 0.5 day |
| Modify and commit changes | 0.5 day |
| PR review and merge | 1 day |
| Monitor and validate PRs | 1–2 days |
| **Total** | **~3–4 days** |

Absolutely, David! Automating the validation of your updated Dependabot configuration can help ensure it behaves as expected without manual oversight. Here's a plan to implement a lightweight validation workflow using GitHub Actions:

---

## ✅ **Automated Validation Plan for Dependabot Configuration**

### 🛠️ **Objective**
Automatically verify that Dependabot is configured to target the `development` branch and that it generates pull requests correctly after configuration changes.

---

### 🧰 **Approach**
We'll create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. **Validates the syntax** of the `.github/dependabot.yml` file.
2. **Checks that the `target-branch` is set to `development`**.
3. Optionally, **monitors for new PRs** created by Dependabot and ensures they target the correct branch.

---

### 🧾 **Workflow File: `.github/workflows/validate-dependabot.yml`**

```yaml
name: Validate Dependabot Configuration

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.github/dependabot.yml'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  validate-dependabot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate YAML syntax
        uses: ibiqlik/action-yamllint@v3
        with:
          file_or_dir: .github/dependabot.yml

      - name: Check target-branch is development
        run: |
          if ! grep -q 'target-branch: development' .github/dependabot.yml; then
            echo "❌ target-branch is not set to 'development'"
            exit 1
          else
            echo "✅ target-branch is correctly set to 'development'"
          fi
```

---

### 🧪 **Optional: PR Monitoring (Advanced)**

If you'd like to go further, you can use GitHub’s REST API or a scheduled workflow to:
- List recent PRs created by `dependabot[bot]`
- Check that their base branch is `development`
- Alert if any PRs are targeting the wrong branch

Let me know if you'd like help setting that up too!

---

### 📌 **Next Steps**
Would you like me to:
- Generate this workflow file for you?
- Extend it to include PR monitoring?
- Help you test it in a fork or staging branch?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Great! Here's how we can test the updated Dependabot configuration in a **fork or staging branch** of the `azurelustre-csi-driver` project:

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Guide to Test Dependabot in a Fork or Staging Branch

### 1. **Fork the Repository**
If you haven’t already:
- Go to the https://github.com/azurelustre-csi-driver (or your internal equivalent).
- Click **Fork** in the top-right corner.
- Choose your GitHub account or organization.

### 2. **Create a Staging Branch**
In your fork:
```bash
git checkout -b dependabot-config-test
```

### 3. **Add or Modify `.github/dependabot.yml`**
Update the file to include the `target-branch: development` directive:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    target-branch: "development"
```

> You can include multiple ecosystems (e.g., `pip`, `docker`, etc.) if needed.

### 4. **Push the Branch**
```bash
git add .github/dependabot.yml
git commit -m "Test: update dependabot to target development branch"
git push origin dependabot-config-test
```

### 5. **Open a Pull Request**
- Create a PR from `dependabot-config-test` to your fork’s `main` or `development` branch.
- This allows GitHub to register the config and trigger Dependabot.

### 6. **Enable GitHub Actions (if needed)**
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your fork and enable workflows if prompted.

### 7. **Monitor Dependabot Behavior**
- Wait for Dependabot to run (usually within a few minutes).
- Check if it opens PRs targeting the `development` branch.
- You can also trigger it manually by editing the config or pushing a dummy dependency change.

---

## ✅ Optional: Add the Validation Workflow

You can also add the `.github/workflows/validate-dependabot.yml` file I shared earlier to your fork to automatically validate the config on push.

Would you like me to generate that file for you now so you can drop it into your repo?

It looks like the attempt to test PR monitoring via GitHub’s API failed due to a **proxy connection issue**, which prevented access to the GitHub API from the current environment.

However, I can still provide you with a **ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow** that you can drop into your repository to automate this validation directly within GitHub. This workflow will:

- Run on a schedule (e.g., daily).
- Use the GitHub CLI to list recent PRs created by `dependabot[bot]`.
- Fail the workflow if any PRs are targeting a branch other than `development`.

---

## ✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow: `.github/workflows/monitor-dependabot-prs.yml`**

```yaml
name: Monitor Dependabot PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Runs daily at 6 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-dependabot-prs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up GitHub CLI
        uses: cli/cli-action@v2

      - name: Fetch recent PRs from Dependabot
        run: |
          gh auth setup-git
          gh auth login --with-token <<< "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          prs=$(gh pr list --state all --limit 100 --json title,baseRefName,author,url,createdAt \
            --jq '.[] | select(.author.login == "dependabot[bot]") | select(.baseRefName != "development") | "\(.title) -> \(.baseRefName) \(.url)"')

          if [[ -n "$prs" ]]; then
            echo "❌ Dependabot PRs targeting incorrect branches:"
            echo "$prs"
            exit 1
          else
            echo "✅ All Dependabot PRs target the 'development' branch."
          fi
```

---

### 🔐 **Setup Notes**
- This uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so no additional secrets are needed.
- You can adjust the `cron` schedule to run more or less frequently.
- The workflow will fail if any Dependabot PRs are found targeting a branch other than `development`.

---

Would you like me to generate this file for you so you can upload it directly to your repo?
Certainly! Below is the **full GitHub Actions workflow** that monitors for Dependabot pull requests targeting branches other than `development`. You can copy this into your repository under `.github/workflows/monitor-dependabot-prs.yml`.

---

### 📄 `.github/workflows/monitor-dependabot-prs.yml`

```yaml
name: Monitor Dependabot PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Runs daily at 6 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-dependabot-prs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up GitHub CLI
        uses: cli/cli-action@v2

      - name: Authenticate GitHub CLI
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" | gh auth login --with-token

      - name: Fetch recent Dependabot PRs not targeting 'development'
        id: check_prs
        run: |
          echo "🔍 Checking for Dependabot PRs not targeting 'development'..."
          prs=$(gh pr list --state all --limit 100 --json title,baseRefName,author,url,createdAt \
            --jq '.[] | select(.author.login == "dependabot[bot]") | select(.baseRefName != "development") | "\(.title) -> \(.baseRefName) \(.url)"')

          if [[ -n "$prs" ]]; then
            echo "❌ Dependabot PRs targeting incorrect branches found:"
            echo "$prs"
            echo "prs=$prs" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            exit 1
          else
            echo "✅ All Dependabot PRs target the 'development' branch."
          fi
```

---

### ✅ What This Workflow Does

- **Runs daily** or on manual trigger.
- Uses the **GitHub CLI** to list recent PRs.
- Filters for PRs created by `dependabot[bot]` that **do not** target the `development` branch.
- **Fails the workflow** if any such PRs are found, printing their titles and URLs.

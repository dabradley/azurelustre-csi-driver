Thanks for referencing the [azurelustre-csi-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver) codebase. Based on the structure and conventions used in that repository, hereâ€™s a clearer and more developer-friendly rewrite of your action items:

### ðŸ”§ Developer-Friendly Action Items for `azurelustre-csi-driver`

1. **Refactor Tests into Proper Packages**
   - Move test code into dedicated `*_test` packages to avoid accessing unexported internals. This improves encapsulation and aligns with Go testing best practices.

2. **Eliminate Use of `reflect.DeepEqual`**
   - Replace `reflect.DeepEqual` with more robust and intention-revealing assertions (e.g., `cmp.Diff`, `go-cmp`, or testifyâ€™s `assert.Equal`) to improve test clarity and failure diagnostics.

3. **Split `credentials_test.go`**
   - Refactor `credentials_test.go` into two distinct test files:
     - One for actual test cases.
     - One for reusable test helpers (if still needed).
   - Enable `t.Helper()` in helper functions to improve error tracebacks.

4. **Enable `t.Parallel()` Where Safe**
   - Review test functions and enable `t.Parallel()` where there are no shared state dependencies. This will speed up test execution and surface concurrency issues early.

5. **Improve `util_test.go` Coverage**
   - Address the `unparam` linter warning: ensure that test cases in `util_test.go` cover multiple input scenarios and validate meaningful behavior.

6. **Evaluate and Possibly Remove `fault-test`**
   - Review the purpose and usage of the `fault-test` directory or module. If it's outdated, redundant, or unused, consider removing it to reduce maintenance overhead.

Based on the context of the [azurelustre-csi-driver GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver), hereâ€™s a clearer and more developer-friendly version of your action items list:

---

### ðŸ”§ **Code Quality & Maintenance**
1. **Audit Global Variables**  
   Review the use of global variables across the codebase. Determine if they are necessary or if they can be refactored into local scope or encapsulated within structs for better modularity and testability.

2. **Error Handling Consistency (`err113`)**  
   Apply the `err113` linter rule: ensure all errors are wrapped with context using `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` or similar. This improves traceability during debugging.

3. **Variable Naming (`varnamelen`)**  
   Investigate any linter or style warnings related to variable name length. Ensure variable names are descriptive and conform to Go naming conventions.

---

### ðŸ§ª **Testing & Compatibility**
4. **Legacy AKS Version Testing**  
   Create a test scenario that provisions an older AKS version. Validate that the CSI driver installs, runs, and upgrades correctly in that environment.

---

### ðŸš€ **Deployment Enhancements**
5. **Add Helm Charts**  
   Package the deployment manifests into Helm charts to simplify installation and configuration. This will also support versioned releases and easier upgrades.

6. **Restrict Host Access**  
   Implement and test a configuration that disables host access from the CSI driver pods. This is important for enforcing security boundaries in multi-tenant clusters.

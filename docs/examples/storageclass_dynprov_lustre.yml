  name: dynprov.azurelustre.csi.azure.com
parameters:
  # See the driver-parameters.md file for a full description of parameters.
  #
  # SKU name for the Azure Managed Lustre file system. The SKU determines the throughput of the AMLFS cluster.
  # This value must be one of:
  # "AMLFS-Durable-Premium-40"
  # "AMLFS-Durable-Premium-125"
  # "AMLFS-Durable-Premium-250"
  # "AMLFS-Durable-Premium-500"
  sku-name: {SKU_NAME}
  #
  # The availability zone where your resource will be created.
  # For the best performance, locate your AMLFS cluster in the same region and availability zone that houses your AKS cluster and other compute clients.
  # The zone must be a single value e.g., "1", "2", or "3".
  zones: {ZONE}
  #
  # The day of the week for maintenance to be performed on the AMLFS cluster, "Sunday", "Monday", etc.
  maintenance-day-of-week: {MAINTENANCE_DAY}
  #
  # The time (in UTC) when the maintenance window can begin on the AMLFS cluster. Time value can only be in 24-hour format i.e., HH:MM
  maintenance-time-of-day-utc: {TIME_OF_DAY}
  #
  # Optional parameters:
  #
  # Azure region in which the AMLFS cluster will be created. The region name should only have lower-case letters or numbers.
  # If empty, the driver will use the same region name as the current AKS cluster.
  # location: {LOCATION}
  #
  # The name of the resource group in which to create the AMLFS cluster. This resource group must already exist.
  # If empty, the driver will use the AKS infrastructure resource group.
  # resource-group-name: {RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}
  #
  # The name of the resource group containing the virtual network to be connected to the AMLFS cluster. This resource group must already exist.
  # vnet-resource-group: {EXISTING_VNET_RG}
  #
  # The name of the virtual network to be connected to the AMLFS cluster. This virtual network must already exist. Setup any virtual network peerings beforehand.
  # vnet-name: {EXISTING_VNET_NAME}
  #
  # The name of the subnet within the virtual network to be connected to the AMLFS cluster. This subnet must already exist.
  # subnet-name: {EXISTING_SUBNET_NAME}
  #
  # User-assigned identities to assign to the AMLFS cluster. These identities must already exist. | This must be the resource identifier for the identity e.g., `"/subscriptions/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myManagedIdentity"`
  # identities: {IDENTITIES}
  #
  # Tags to apply to the AMLFS cluster resource. These tags do not affect AMLFS cluster functionality. Tag format: `"key1=val1,key2=val2"`.
  # tags: {TAGS}
  #
  # The subdirectory within the AMLFS cluster's root directory which is where each pod will actually be mounted within the AMLFS filesystem.
  # This subdirectory does not need to exist beforehand. This must be a valid Linux file path.
  # It can also interpret metadata such as `"${pvc.metadata.name}"`, `"${pvc.metadata.namespace}"`, `"${pv.metadata.name}"`, `"${pod.metadata.name}"`, `"${pod.metadata.namespace}"`, `"${pod.metadata.uid}"`.
